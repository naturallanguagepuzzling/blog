 Companion code for naturallanguagepuzzling.blogspot.com

This repo contains companion scripts and files for my NLP and word puzzle blog at:
https://naturallanguagepuzzling.blogspot.com

The blog is focused on the Sunday Puzzle from NPR, hosted by Will Shortz. You can find the Sunday Puzzle here:
https://www.npr.org/series/4473090/sunday-puzzle

Each week, I do a breakdown and brainstorming post following the puzzle broadcast. Later in the week, I post my solution, along with a discussion of how I got it and any scripts and text files I created to do so. Listeners have until Thursdays at 3pm ET, so I always wait until later Thursday or Friday to post solutions so that I'm not spoiling it.

Thanks for checking out my blog!
