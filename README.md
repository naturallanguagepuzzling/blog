 Companion repo for naturallanguagepuzzling.blogspot.com

This repo contains companion scripts and files for my blog at:
https://naturallanguagepuzzling.blogspot.com


The blog is focused on applying natural language processing (NLP), linguistics and basic programming to solve word puzzles. Specifically, each week, I attempt the Sunday Puzzle from NPR, hosted by Will Shortz. You can find the Sunday Puzzle here:
https://www.npr.org/series/4473090/sunday-puzzle

I lay out my thoughts on each puzzle in a breakdown and brainstorming post following the broadcast (or podcast). Later in the week, I post my solution, along with a discussion of how I got it and any scripts and text files I created to do so. Listeners have until Thursdays at 3pm ET to submit their solution to the NPR contest, so I always wait until later Thursday or Friday to post solutions so that I'm not spoiling it.

Please keep in mind this work is all for one-off puzzles, so the scripts you'll find here are generally not optimized! You'll see a lot of brute force approaches and some inefficient code. I have tentative plans to package some of my most commonly used puzzle solving functions; feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a small python library.

Thanks for checking out my blog!
