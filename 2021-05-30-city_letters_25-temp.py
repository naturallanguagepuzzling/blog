"""
This week's challenge comes from listener Al Gori, of Oak Ridge, N.J. Name a
famous city in 10 letters that contains an "S." Drop the "S." Then assign the
remaining nine letters their standard value in the alphabet â€” A = 1, B= 2,
C = 3, etc. The total value of the nine letters is only 25. What city is it?
